# simple-static-apps

The tools in this repo were coded with the aid of AI. I used Jetbrains Junie to
create most of the code in this repo.

The main idea behind the apps in this repo is that they should be pure
html+css+javascript with no external depencies and no backend required. The
pattern is to have each app keep their data in IndexedDB in the browser, and
provide import/export functionality so the user can backup their data to their
device when desired
